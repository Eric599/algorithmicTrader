# algorithmicTrader

Welcome to my first attempt at creating an algorithmic trader.

Everything created is made purely for entertainment and is not meant to be used as financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor do I claim to be one.

My first prototype attempt will aim to measure if a company is profitable long term.

Eventually, I would like to give the user a choice to pick if they are looking for a short term or long term investment.

To start I will focus on one company, Apple. Once I am confident with my work on Apple, I would like to develop a user interface where a user can input any publicly traded company and in return receive an analysis based purely on numbers calculated through the yfinance library.

This project will use Python.
